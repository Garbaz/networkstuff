# Network scripts and stuff

## IMPORTANT:
Some of these scripts do stuff, which is illegal to do in public networks! It is your responsibility to educate yourself about what they are doing and to establish an appropriate envoirement to test them in.
If you get in trouble for attemtping malicious attacks, it is your trouble, not mine. None of the used tools (e.g. ettercap) are created by me and thereby I am not responsible for what they are capable of (and what you are doing with them).

#### What is this?:
A collection of scripts I created for various kinds of simple network "hacks". They are just a way to automate running tools like ettercap or nmap.
Some scripts will work, some won't, depending on your distro and setup. If you are unable to edit them appropriately, read up on the corresponding commands.
